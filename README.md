## Hi there 👋

I am a software engineer passionate about beautiful code and amazing developer experiences. Currently, I'm exploring programming language design + compilation, mobile development, and physics simulations.

### Current Projects
- [conjure](https://github.com/Ant13731/conjure): Control your computer as if it were a hologram! A remote control for your computer that uses your hands and gestures as a remote.
- [simile](https://github.com/Ant13731/simile): A high level formal-specification-based programming language with rewrite-based optimizations founded in set theory, targeting LLVM.

### Past Projects
- [nodify](https://github.com/Ant13731/nodify-dev): Data-flow visualization tool for any Python or Typescript repository. Install as a VSCode extension.
- [2-D Charged Particle Simulation](https://github.com/Ant13731/2D-Charged-Particle-Simulation)
- [Chess Prediction CNN-RNN](https://github.com/Ant13731/Chess-Prediction-Model)
